All source code in this repo should not be used in production. This is for
development purpose only. Feel free to clone/fork the repo and modify as
expected.

## Overview

A simple microservice application using REST, SOAP and Webhooks. The SOAP server
is written in PHP, allowing you call procedures remotely. JSON is used over XML
for simplicity. REST is done through Python Flask, which is also responsible for
handling webhook requests from GitHub and publishing updates to React via
WebSocket.

## Highlevel Architecture Overview

![Architecture](architecture.svg)

The entire application is expected to be dockerized and deployed on
[AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)

## What has been done for me?

The following have been implemented for you to make it easier for you to get
started. The requirments document should contain all the information you need to
get started.

1. A SOAP server written in PHP
2. A SOAP client written in Python
3. Project bootstraped for PHP, Python and React
4. An ORM written in PHP (don't use in production ðŸ˜‰)
5. PHPUnit has been setup correctly
6. ORM thorougly tested ðŸ˜‰ ðŸ¤” ðŸ˜‰
7. And lots more

## What we didn't do for you
